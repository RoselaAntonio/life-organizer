This a daily planner that helps the user create a schedule.

This daily planner will show the current date on top of the page in the format of: "Day, Month and Date." 

Along with that, the daily planner shown will be presented in timeblocks that follow standard business hours (9AM - 5PM).
Each time block is color-coded and features a save button that saves it in local storage. The color-coding is there as it will help indicate whether the task written is in the past, present, or future.

The website should mimic this image:
